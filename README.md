This is a Depression Detection system, in which an user using our system is given a set of philosophical/Heart_Touching questions
depending on his/her reaction while and after reading the question, distinguishes between an normal and an a depressed person.
We capture those moments and feed to our Clarifai API implemented in python, to detect any problem.

Our Challenge lies here are :
  1: Designing a Philosophically/Heart_Touching questions, targetted for depressed people.
  2: Creating a UI that's best suited for depressed people.
  3: Reporting data.
  4: Camera Quality.
